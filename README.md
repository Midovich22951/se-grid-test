Selenium Testing & Monitoring
----

Project provides utilities to
- Test Se Grid Infrastructure - after it was updated or restarted it makes sense running checks whether Grid started
 successfully and browsers can still be started and do what they need to do. [MORE INFO ON SE GRID TESTS](./selenium-infrastructure-tests/README.md).
- Monitoring of Selenium Grid - provides JMX & HTTP means to monitor how Grid is doing - how many sessions are running,
 whether it's overloaded, etc. [MORE INFO ON SE GRID MONITORING](./selenium-monitoring/README.md).

### TBD

Right now the project is pretty young, it's not very generic and might have lots of things to improve. Feel free to contribute.
